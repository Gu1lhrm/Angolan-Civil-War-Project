<h1>Angolan Civil War Project</h1>

    <p>
        The Angolan Project is an school project done using HTML, JS, and CSS, where my teacher asked us to chose between an poem, music, website to do as an graded assessment. My group chose to do an website for this assignment, and instead of using an already done template or an third party tools - such as Google Sites or Wix - we used HTML, JS, and CSS. The assignment consisted on doing an general historical context on the Angolan War, De-colonization (with examples from contries other than Angola that went through similar processes). The website consists of two pages; the first one is where all the infomation asked by the teacher is, it also consists images of that time; The second page is an quiz about the content. Using JS we were able to provide grading for the answers provided, and depending on the amount of questions answered correctly, it gives an <code>&lt;window.alert&gt;</code> with one of the possible outcomes {AE, PR, MS, ID, NI}, which represents the grading system of our school (AE = 5 correct answers, PR = 4, MS = 3, ID = 2, and NI = 1/0).
